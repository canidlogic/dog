# Dog resources

This directory contains resource files that are required for the client-side pages:

- `main.css` is a CSS stylesheet (MIME type `text/css`)
- `gallery.js` is a JavaScript file (MIME type `text/javascript`)

It is recommended that these be included as global resources in the Yip CMS database.
